# Video Editor Portfolio: Demo Walkthrough & Engineering Notes

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page:**
   - User submits their portfolio URL.
   - The app validates the URL and sends it to `/api/portfolio`.
   - On success, the user is redirected to their profile page (e.g., `/sonuchoudhary`).
2. **Profile Page:**
   - Displays structured info: name, summary, employers/clients, and videos.
   - User can edit any field, add/remove employers, and add/remove videos.
   - Changes are saved via `/api/savePortfolio` (mocked).

## Component Structure

- **App Layout:** Global styles, fonts, and layout.
- **Landing Page:** Form for portfolio URL submission.
- **Profile Page:**
  - **Notification:** Shows errors/success.
  - **EmployerCard:** Handles employer/client info and video list.
  - **VideoCard:** Handles video display/editing.

## State Management

- Uses React `useState` for local state (profile, editing, errors, etc.).
- Form validation with `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
- No global state or context needed for this scope.

## Scalability & Edge Cases

- **Scalability:**
  - Modular components for easy extension.
  - Typescript for type safety.
  - For 10,000+ portfolios: would use pagination, lazy loading, and backend APIs with caching.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Handles invalid URLs, empty states, and API errors.
  - Accessible UI (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
  - Flexible enough to support various portfolio layouts.

## AI Usage

- Used GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for code suggestions, refactoring, and brainstorming UI/UX improvements.
- Manually improved:
  - Accessibility (ARIA, keyboard, color contrast)
  - Error handling and edge cases
  - Modularization and code comments
- Creative use: Prompted AI for best practices, empty state design, and API documentation structure.

# How AI Was Used in This Project

## Key Prompts & Tools Used

- Used for code completion, generating boilerplate React/TypeScript code, and suggesting component structures.
- Used to brainstorm UI/UX patterns, clarify API documentation structure, and get advice on best practices for modularity and accessibility.
- Used for UI inspiration and layout brainstorming.

## Manual Modifications & Improvements

- Refactored AI-generated code for clarity, modularity, and maintainability.
- Improved accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast) beyond AI suggestions.
- Enhanced error handling, empty states, and edge case management.
- Wrote and organized documentation, comments, and API docs to ensure clarity and alignment with assignment requirements.

## Creative Use of AI

- Used AI to quickly scaffold repetitive UI elements and forms, saving significant development time.
- Prompted AI for alternative UI layouts and empty state designs to improve user experience.
- Leveraged AI to review and optimize code for performance and scalability (e.g., component memoization, prop drilling reduction).
- Used AI to draft initial API documentation, then manually tailored it for clarity and completeness.
