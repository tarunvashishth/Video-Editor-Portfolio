# Video Editor Portfolio: Demo Walkthrough & Engineering Notes

## User Flow

1. **Landing Page:**
   - User submits their portfolio URL.
   - The app validates the URL and sends it to `/api/portfolio`.
   - On success, the user is redirected to their profile page (e.g., `/sonuchoudhary`).
2. **Profile Page:**
   - Displays structured info: name, summary, employers/clients, and videos.
   - User can edit any field, add/remove employers, and add/remove videos.
   - Changes are saved via `/api/savePortfolio` (mocked).

## Architecture Overview

This project uses the Next.js App Router with TypeScript for type safety and modularity. The main building blocks are:

- **Pages**: Located in `src/app/`, including the landing page and dynamic user profile pages.
- **API Routes**: Located in `src/app/api/`, for handling portfolio submission and saving.
- **Components**: Modular, reusable UI components in `src/components/` (e.g., `EmployerCard`, `VideoCard`, `Notification`).
- **Types**: All data models are defined in `src/types/portfolio.ts`.
- **Mock Data**: Used for demonstration, found in `src/data/mockPortfolio.ts`.

The UI is styled with Tailwind CSS and uses the Geist font for a modern look. Form validation is handled with `react-hook-form` and `zod`.

## Component Structure

- **App Layout:** Global styles, fonts, and layout.
- **Landing Page:** Form for portfolio URL submission.
- **Profile Page:**
  - **Notification:** Shows errors/success.
  - **EmployerCard:** Handles employer/client info and video list.
  - **VideoCard:** Handles video display/editing.

## State Management

- Uses React `useState` for local state (profile, editing, errors, etc.).
- Form validation with `react-hook-form` and `zod`.
- No global state or context needed for this scope.

## Scalability & Edge Cases

- **Scalability:**
  - Modular components for easy extension.
  - Typescript for type safety.
  - For 10,000+ portfolios: would use pagination, lazy loading, and backend APIs with caching.
- **Edge Cases:**
  - Handles invalid URLs, empty states, and API errors.
  - Accessible UI (ARIA, keyboard navigation, color contrast).
  - Flexible enough to support various portfolio layouts.

## AI Usage

### Key AI Prompts & Tools Used

- "Suggest a modular React component structure for a portfolio editor."
- "How can I handle form validation and error states in a Next.js?"
- "Show me best practices for accessible, editable forms with Tailwind CSS."
- "Draft a 1-page API documentation for backend."
- "Brainstorm empty state and error UI for a creative portfolio app."
- Used **GitHub Copilot** for code completion, boilerplate, and refactoring suggestions.
- Used **ChatGPT** for brainstorming UI/UX, documentation, and code review.

### Manual Modifications & Improvements

- Refactored and modularized AI-generated code for clarity, maintainability, and assignment fit.
- Improved accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, color contrast) beyond AI suggestions.
- Enhanced error handling, empty states, and edge case management.
- Wrote and organized documentation, comments, and API docs to ensure clarity and alignment with assignment requirements.

### Creative Use of AI

- Used AI to quickly scaffold repetitive UI elements and forms, saving significant development time.
- Prompted AI for alternative UI layouts and empty state designs to improve user experience.
- Leveraged AI to review and optimize code for performance and scalability (e.g., component memoization, prop drilling reduction).
- Used AI to draft initial API documentation, then manually tailored it for clarity and completeness.

## Bonus: How to Scale for 10,000+ Portfolios

- Use server-side pagination and infinite scroll for portfolio lists.
- Store portfolios in a database with indexing for fast queries.
- Use caching.
- Decouple UI into smaller, memoized components.
- Use job queues for real-time matching to job descriptions.
