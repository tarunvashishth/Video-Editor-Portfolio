# Contributing to Video Editor Portfolio

Thank you for considering contributing to this project! Here are some guidelines to help you get started.

## Project Structure

- **src/app/**: Next.js app directory (pages, API routes, layout)
- **src/components/**: Reusable React components
- **src/types/**: TypeScript type definitions
- **src/data/**: Mock/sample data

## How to Contribute

1. **Fork the repository** and create your branch from `main`.
2. **Write clear, modular code** and add comments where necessary.
3. **Add or update tests** if applicable.
4. **Document your changes** in the code and update the README if needed.
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description of your changes.

## Code Style

- Use TypeScript and React best practices.
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling.
- Keep components small and focused.
- Prefer functional components and hooks.

## Communication

- Use clear commit messages.
- Explain architectural or design decisions in PRs.

## How AI Was Used

- **AI tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT** were used to accelerate coding, brainstorm UI directions, and improve efficiency.
- AI was used for:
  - Generating code suggestions and boilerplate
  - Brainstorming UI/UX patterns and best practices
  - Reviewing and refactoring code for clarity and modularity
- All architectural decisions, component structure, and final implementations were made manually to ensure a strong technical foundation and code quality.
- No full-stack agentic AI tools (e.g., Replit, Lovable) were used to generate the entire app. All code was reviewed, tested, and improved by hand.
